# NexusKrop.FreeDesktop

This library provides high-level FreeDesktop .NET APIs to GNU/Linux and potentially other Unix-like desktop operating systems. Unlike your potential UI libraries, this library deals directly with the FreeDesktop `dbus` communication thanks to the `Tmds.DBus` library.

The structure of the API is inspired by to [Windows Runtime API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/).

## Usage

This library is in an early stage of development, and does not have packages yet!

**Tests must be ran in a desktop environment!**
